This is meant to be a web-based "clone" of the Google Chrome extension "Momentum" a New Tab page that gives you a moment of calm and inspires you to be more productive. Get inspired with a daily photo and quote, set a daily focus, and track your to-dos. The extension allows you to:

  • Get a new inspirational photo and quote each day
  • Set a daily goal/focus/intention
  • Keep track of tasks with a Todo list
  • See the weather and forecast
  • Show bookmarks bar on new tab
  • Default Chrome Tab/Apps links
  • Customize the dashboard by showing/hiding widgets
  
My application is built using a Rails backend, for persiting user data and allowing use by multiple users via creating an account. The frontend of this application will be built using React.js. 

Visually, the apps will look similar to one another with a few functionality changes, being: 

  • The use of a backend rather than sole-reliance on local storage for persiting data.
  • A web application-based interface as opposed to a Chrome Extension.
